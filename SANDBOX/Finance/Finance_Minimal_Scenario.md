# Minimal Financial Scenario — CANON Interpretation

## Purpose of this scenario

This document illustrates **how a CANON decision**
can be interpreted in a financial context.

It does **not** use:

* real market data
* prices
* probabilities
* simulations

The goal is **conceptual clarity**, not empirical performance.

---

## The setting (abstract)

Assume an informational system representing:

* a market segment
* a portfolio structure
* a macro-financial environment

This system is mapped to a valid `LMetrics` state
by an external engine (outside CANON).

No assumption is made on how this mapping is computed.

---

## CANON output

From CANON, we obtain:

* a phase classification:

  * SAFE
  * WARNING
  * or BLACKHOLE

* and a logical guarantee:

  > a coherent decision exists for this state

This decision is **realized**, not computed.

---

## Financial interpretation of phases

### SAFE

Interpretation:

* informationally stable regime
* accessible structure
* no dominant barriers

Financial reading:

* strategies remain structurally viable
* uncertainty is present but not obstructive
* regime supports continuation, not stress reactions

This does **not** mean “low risk” or “profit”.

---

### WARNING

Interpretation:

* transitional or unstable regime
* no collapse, but no guarantees

Financial reading:

* regime sensitivity is high
* small changes may alter accessibility
* decisions should be conservative and reversible

This is a **diagnostic state**, not a failure.

---

### BLACKHOLE

Interpretation:

* dominant informational barriers
* collapse of accessibility

Financial reading:

* strategies lose structural meaning
* traditional optimization becomes unreliable
* exposure should be questioned at the regime level

This is **not a crash prediction**.

---

## What this scenario proves

This scenario demonstrates that:

* CANON decisions can be interpreted
  without numeric models
* financial meaning can emerge
  from structural information alone
* the engine does not decide actions,
  it reveals regimes

---

## What this scenario does NOT claim

* no timing advantage
* no profitability
* no forecasting power
* no risk quantification

Any such claim belongs to **future layers**,
not to this sandbox.

---

## Role in the project

This minimal scenario is:

* the conceptual bridge
* the onboarding artifact
* the guardrail against misuse

It ensures that finance remains
**downstream, interpretable, and honest**.

---

## Status

* Conceptual: complete
* Mathematical: grounded in CANON
* Operational: intentionally absent

This is by design.
