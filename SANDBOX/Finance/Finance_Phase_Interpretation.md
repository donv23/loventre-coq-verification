# Financial Interpretation of CANON Phases

## Scope

This document defines a **financial interpretation layer**
for the CANON phase semantics:

* SAFE
* WARNING
* BLACKHOLE

This interpretation is **purely semantic**.

It introduces:

* no axioms
* no guarantees
* no formal claims

All formal correctness derives exclusively from CANON.

---

## Principle

A financial system is not classified by performance,
but by **informational stability**.

Financial interpretation operates on the output of CANON,
never on raw market data.

---

## Phase Interpretations

### SAFE — Stable Financial Regime

A financial state is interpreted as **SAFE** when:

* informational tunneling is effective
* success probability is structurally high
* the system remains adaptive under perturbations

Financial meaning:

* low systemic fragility
* controlled leverage
* recoverable downside
* robustness to volatility

SAFE does **not** mean “risk-free”.
It means **structurally navigable risk**.

---

### WARNING — Transitional Financial Regime

A financial state is interpreted as **WARNING** when:

* informational stability is incomplete
* the system is neither collapsing nor stable
* small perturbations may cause regime shifts

Financial meaning:

* sensitivity to shocks
* leverage near critical thresholds
* path-dependence
* non-linear risk amplification

WARNING is **not failure**.
It is a **critical zone**.

---

### BLACKHOLE — Collapse Financial Regime

A financial state is interpreted as **BLACKHOLE** when:

* informational tunneling is ineffective
* success probability collapses
* recovery paths are structurally blocked

Financial meaning:

* systemic illiquidity
* runaway leverage
* irreversibility
* hidden tail risks becoming dominant

BLACKHOLE is not a prediction.
It is a **structural diagnosis**.

---

## Important Clarifications

* These interpretations are **not forecasts**
* They are **not trading signals**
* They are **not risk metrics**

They are **structural classifications**
derived from CANON phase semantics.

## Compliance with CANON

This document complies with the SANDBOX rule:

> Every financial interpretation is a realization of a
> CANON-guaranteed phase classification.

No additional authority is claimed.

---

## Status

* CANON: authoritative
* Finance interpretation: exploratory
* Numerical models: deferred

This document defines the **semantic foundation**
for future financial sandbox modules.
