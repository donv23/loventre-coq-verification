# Loventre Financial Sandbox

## Purpose

This sandbox explores **financial interpretations**
of the Loventre CANON without modifying or extending it.

The goal is not prediction, optimization, or trading,
but **structural diagnosis of financial regimes**
through informational geometry.

---

## What this sandbox is

This sandbox is:

* a semantic layer
* a controlled experimental space
* a downstream interpretation of CANON

It translates **CANON phase semantics** into
financially meaningful regimes.

---

## What this sandbox is NOT

This sandbox is **not**:

* a trading system
* a forecasting engine
* a pricing model
* a risk metric
* a substitute for CANON

No numerical guarantee is introduced here.

---

## Conceptual Architecture

```
CANON (formal, verified)
   ↓
Phase classification (SAFE / WARNING / BLACKHOLE)
   ↓
Financial semantic interpretation
   ↓
[future] numerical or empirical modules
```

All correctness flows **top-down**.

---

## Why this matters

Traditional financial models operate on:

* historical data
* probabilistic assumptions
* local risk metrics

The Loventre approach operates on:

* informational stability
* structural accessibility
* regime geometry

This allows a **qualitative shift**:
from “how much risk”
to “what kind of regime”.

---

## Design constraints

This sandbox follows strict constraints:

* no new axioms
* no modification of CANON
* no hidden assumptions
* explicit separation between theory and application

Violating these constraints invalidates the sandbox.

---

## Status

* CANON: frozen, authoritative
* SANDBOX: exploratory
* Finance layer: semantic-only
* Numerical models: intentionally deferred

This sandbox is a **bridge**, not a replacement.

## Authorship and scope

Author: Vincenzo Loventre
Formal core: Coq-verified CANON
Scope: research, applied theory, exploratory finance

This sandbox exists to **add value without erosion**.
